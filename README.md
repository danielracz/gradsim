## Abstract: 

Feed-forward networks can be interpreted as mappings with
linear decision surfaces at the level of the last layer. We investigate how
the tangent space of the network can be exploited to refine the decision in
case of ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activations. We show that a simple
Riemannian metric parametrized on the parameters of the network forms a
similarity function at least as good as the original network and we suggest
a sparse metric to increase the similarity gap.
